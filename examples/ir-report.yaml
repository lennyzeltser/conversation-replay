          EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

          On [date], a Business Email Compromise (BEC) attempt
          targeted our organization. An attacker impersonating
          the CEO requested a $47,500 wire transfer from the CFO.

          The attack was detected before funds were transferred
          when the CFO verbally confirmed the request with the CEO.

          Immediate actions: Email headers analyzed, account
          security reviewed, finance team alerted to new protocols.

          An attacker gained access to the CEO's email account
          and sent a convincing wire transfer request to the CFO.
          The email matched the CEO's writing style and referenced
          an actual pending acquisition, showing the attacker had
          researched our company.
