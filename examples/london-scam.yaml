      - type: message

        from: victim
        content: "Hi Matt. Everything OK?"

      - type: annotation

      - type: message
        from: attacker
        content: "well, im really stuck here in london. i had to visit a resort here in london and i got robbed at the hotel im staying"

      - type: annotation
        content: "The scam begins. The attacker creates urgency with a crisis story. The 'London emergency' is one of the most common social engineering pretexts."

      - type: message
        from: victim
        content: "Oh no! Are you OK? Did you call the police?"

      - type: message
        from: attacker
        content: "yes i did, but they said it might take a while to get my stuff back. the problem is i need to pay my hotel bill and get a flight home"

      - type: annotation
        content: "The attacker builds on the crisis, establishing a clear financial need. They're setting up the ask."

      - type: message
        from: attacker
        content: "i was wondering if you could help me out with some money? ill pay you back as soon as i get home"

      - type: message
        from: victim
        content: "How much do you need? And how would I send it?"

      - type: message
        from: attacker
        content: "about $1500 would cover the hotel and flight. you can send it through western union - its the fastest way"

      - type: annotation
        content: "Western Union is the preferred method because transfers are difficult to trace or reverse. This is a major red flag."

      - type: message
        from: victim
        content: "That's a lot of money. Can't you call the embassy or your bank?"

      - type: message
        from: attacker
        content: "i tried but they said it would take days. please, i really need your help. i promise ill pay you back"

      - type: annotation
        content: "The attacker increases pressure and appeals to friendship. Real friends would understand delays - scammers push urgency."

      - type: transition
        content: "Red flags in this conversation: urgency, money request, Western Union, resistance to alternatives"
