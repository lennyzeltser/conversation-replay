# Agents

Before working on this project, review [README.md](./README.md) for:
- Project purpose: CLI tool generating animated conversation demos from YAML
- YAML schema for scenarios, participants, and steps
- Repository structure and key source files
- Development commands and architecture
- Security considerations (input validation, output safety)
- Key logic: `src/generator.ts` handles the Premium UI (glassmorphism), automatic embedding detection, and multi-scenario logic.

See the **AI Agent Quick Reference** section for file locations and common tasks.
